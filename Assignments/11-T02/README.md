## Topics Covered To Date

These are the topics we have covered in class up to the week of March 26th. This is a decent chunk of real estate! The exam of course will not cover all of these topics, but I wanted to list them out so you could see what we are accomplishing!  I invite slack questions or questions in class about any and all of these topics if you feel like we need to clarify anything.
