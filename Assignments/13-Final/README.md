- [This reply on stack overflow about heaps (which is a priority queue) embodies what I try to get across in my class:](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18993269/difference-between-priority-queue-and-a-heap)
    >**A priority queue is an abstract datatype**. It is a shorthand way of describing a particular interface and behavior, and says nothing about the underlying implementation. 
    >
    >**A heap is a data structure**. It is a name for a particular way of storing data that makes certain operations very efficient.
    >
    >It just so happens that a **heap** is a very good **data structure** to implement a **priority queue**, *because the operations which are made efficient by the heap data structure are the operations that the priority queue interface needs.*
