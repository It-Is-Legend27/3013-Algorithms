### Example Questions

- For everything you do on this test, know its complexity.
- Be able to write a basic sorting routine like a bubble sort or selection sort and know the difference between them.
- Given an array, perform a binary search to find a specific key.
- Describe the difference between searching:
  - a list
  - an array
  - an ordered list
  - an ordered array
  - a bst
- Heap
  - What is it?
  - What can it be used for?
  - Describe the difference between inserting items into a heap and building a heap from an array of values
- Given a list of unordered numbers, load them into an array based binary search tree
- Given a list of unordered numbers, load them into a binary search tree
- Given a list of unordered numbers, load them into a heap.
- Delete a value from a given binary tree
- Write a recursive traversal of a binary search tree. 
- Do an inorder, preorder, and postorder traversal of a tree.
